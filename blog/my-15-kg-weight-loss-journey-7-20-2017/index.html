Similarly, you might work out well for 2 months, but a long vacation to grandma’s might be enough to make you lousy again. These are very fragile methods in my opinion, for my sort of lifestyle in which work, commute, <em>\<em>cough\* Netflix<em> take most of the time.<h3>The Change</h3>So what started the chain of events was this app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness">Google Fit</a></em></em></em>. It’s a basic fitness app that uses your phone sensors to calculate steps/calories burnt/distance covered. That’s pretty much it.<br><img alt="23rd of February is when I installed the app, though it took 3 days to get me to work on my goal." src=img/blog/1__WFkALvcY68HD__PaoixgiiQ.png> 23rd of February is when I installed the app, though it took 3 days to get me to work on my goal.<br>Annnnd I forgot about it for three days. I opened it one day to see that I actually completed the goal of 10,000 steps on a Saturday when I went for a walk by the lake. That was easy! What I also observed was that I roughly burnt 1,700 ~ 2,000 calories by doing nothing throughout the day. Even if the data isn’t accurate, the sensor and environment conditions remain the same, making it a reliable way to observe variations and not the absolute values.<br>My brain was intrigued by these numbers.

At the same time I also went to grandma’s house (= fat rich food), ate out and ate heavy items (= too many calories), and even fall ill (= very little walk). I simply increased my steps for those days or did extra steps later. Basically, I didn’t change my lifestyle at all, apart from dedicating 2–3 hours to walk and cooking daily.<br><img alt="I meet my goals daily, and compensate whenever I eat outside." src=img/blog/1__B3QKpZdPXxmFaDsc9XQbdg.png> I meet my goals daily, and compensate whenever I eat outside.<br>So by minor changes in my lifestyle, I found myself becoming less lethargic, which only helped me improve it more and more. I could work for long hours, walk for 2 hours, then cook food and still feel active!<br>Over time, I also found myself leaning towards a vegan diet. Watching <a href=http://www.cowspiracy.com/ >Cowspiracy</a> and <a href=http://www.whatthehealthfilm.com/ >What the Health</a> helped me with it greatly. I still have milk in coffee (creamer as it’s called in the west) & ice creams on some days though. Still working on it. YouTube Channels like <a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/rawvegannotgross>Raw. Vegan. Not Gross</a> & <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEjkioV3LO_OIUaSWRxFZ3A>Cheap Lazy Vegan</a> help me a lot with non-dairy experiments. It’s simply unavailability of vegan alternatives in India that make me lose to coffee creamer.<br>Some clarifications I want to make here;<br><ul><li>I didn’t starve. I just ate better alternatives. I still had plenty of cheat days, but with reduced quantities and compensation for same.<li>I didn’t exhaust myself. Walking is the most basic exercise which is good for general health and doesn’t quite focus on any one body part. I lost weight not only from my calves & thighs, but also from my face, arms, and waist. I also did push-ups to ensure muscle growth in torso region.<li>Girls are still not interested in me. Sigh.<li>Men on other hand compliment, saying I’ve become leaner. PROFIT???</ul><br>As always, it worked for me, but might not work for you. However, I’ve seen people reduce weight just by, say, getting rid of sugar, or meat, or dairy. In my case, these were already pretty much absent. Apparently, dieting wasn’t enough to pull this off alone, which is why I believe basic exercise like walking together with a better diet helped me overall. My advice would be to not look at long term gains, but to compare between days and weeks.<br>My quest is still on. I intend to sit in the middle of the ideal BMI range, and also improve on my Vegan skills.<br>Here’s a before (Feb 2017, 87kg | 192lb) & after (Oct 2017, 69kg | 152 lb) picture.<br><blockquote><strong>Update Nov 2017:</strong> I lost even more weight since the time I posted this blog, about 3–4 kgs (6.6–8.8 lbs). And I also turned full vegan.</blockquote><br>PS:<br><ul><li>BMI and other such metrics have flaws. Don’t be too serious about them.<li>Losing weight doesn’t always mean better health. Consult a dietitian or whatever.<li>Feel free to analyze my case & give remarks.</ul> </div> </main> </main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,{},(function(a){return {post:{title:"My 15 kg weight loss journey",description:"So coming to my story, I didn’t quite intend to lose weight, or follow anydiet, or did a rigorous workout.

I still have milk in coffee (creamer as it’s called in the west) & ice creams on some days though. Still working on it. YouTube Channels like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fuser\u002Frawvegannotgross\"\u003ERaw. Vegan.

It’s simply unavailability of vegan alternatives in India that make me lose to coffee creamer.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ESome clarifications I want to make here;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI didn’t starve. I just ate better alternatives. I still had plenty of cheat days, but with reduced quantities and compensation for same.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI didn’t exhaust myself. Walking is the most basic exercise which is good for general health and doesn’t quite focus on any one body part. I lost weight not only from my calves & thighs, but also from my face, arms, and waist. I also did push-ups to ensure muscle growth in torso region.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGirls are still not interested in me. Sigh.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMen on other hand compliment, saying I’ve become leaner. PROFIT???\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EAs always, it worked for me, but might not work for you. However, I’ve seen people reduce weight just by, say, getting rid of sugar, or meat, or dairy. In my case, these were already pretty much absent. Apparently, dieting wasn’t enough to pull this off alone, which is why I believe basic exercise like walking together with a better diet helped me overall. My advice would be to not look at long term gains, but to compare between days and weeks.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EMy quest is still on. I intend to sit in the middle of the ideal BMI range, and also improve on my Vegan skills.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EHere’s a before (Feb 2017, 87kg | 192lb) & after (Oct 2017, 69kg | 152 lb) picture.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate Nov 2017:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I lost even more weight since the time I posted this blog, about 3–4 kgs (6.6–8.8 lbs).
