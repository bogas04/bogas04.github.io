I’m guessing you must have faced some friction initially, how it breaks your flow, how you just can’t merge to master without rebasing/merging changes in first.<br />Despite that, you might agree today that it’s actually very helpful in collaborating with the team, and those pain points were necessary to get here.<br />Monorepos are somewhat similar.<br />While git was solving problems around managing single codebase with multiple team members or just better versioning, Monorepo kind of does the same but for multiple projects/codebases.<h3>The what.</h3><blockquote>Is Monorepo that cool font I see on Twitter?</blockquote><br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__ZzlBaQH6w1BgwZdo3bIYRQ.png\" alt=\"Image credits: undraw\"><br />Before diving into the topic, let’s first understand what Monorepo truly means. This is what Wikipedia has to say:<br /><blockquote>In revision control systems, a Monorepo is a software development strategy where code for many projects are stored in the same repository.</blockquote><br />In other words, your ‘Work’ folder is close to what a Monorepo would look like. It would have packages that deal with server, web app, native app, documentation, etc.<br />This is different from a ‘monolith’ where all your application logic is<br />centralized to one entry point as opposed to distributed services (microservices).<br />While code for various services would sit in a single repository, it doesn’t mean it would be deployed as a single entity, just like your ‘Work’ folder. Individual projects have separate life-cycles.<h3>The why.</h3><blockquote>So, do I just <code>git add</code> my entire ‘Work’ folder?</blockquote><br /><blockquote>“Why would you want to do this? Whatever happened to separation of concern?”</blockquote><br />There are several arguments both in favour and against Monorepos. And I don’t mean “Oh Google uses it” kind of arguments. This blog will give a sneak-peek into our problems and Monorepo’s solutions to them.<br />Regardless, I recommend that you identify the problems your codebase is facing, and see if Monorepo is truly the answer to those.<h3>The story.</h3>Before moving to Monorepo, we as a team worked on 3 codebases at the same time;<br /><ul><li><strong>dweb</strong> (Desktop website of Swiggy)</li><li><strong>mweb</strong> (Mobile website of Swiggy)</li><li><strong>service</strong> (API proxy NodeJS middleware, used by dweb and mweb)</li></ul><br />When I say work, I mean writing features, updating build pipeline, reviewing code and fixing bugs.<br />As the codebases grew, we recognized some patterns:<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1____L__bUfSLVT6EboXRO7SSGg.png\" alt=\"Image credits: undraw\"><br /><ul><li>Features written on mweb, while dissimilar enough to not to be dragged and dropped to dweb, held enough similarities to be broken into reusable parts.</li><li>Fixes that go on mweb are also needed on dweb.</li><li>Code reviewers often ended up reviewing the same code (between mweb and dweb) in a slightly different context.</li><li>Code review changes on dweb are also relevant to mweb</li><li>Changes to contracts of service, a common dependency, are also needed to be individually coded, tested, and reviewed.</li><li>Updating dependencies like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>/<a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">Webpack</a>/<a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a> becomes cumbersome between the two codebases.</li><li>Conventions are difficult to enforce between the three repositories. One has an older version of <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a>, one hasn’t been updated when new lint rules were added, one is still using old test runner.</li><li>Attempts to make a new repository to keep common code failed due to the amount of setup and code management. Imagine working with multiple team members on multiple repositories with multiple Pull Requests.</li></ul><br />As you can see, while the projects are very different (check out <a href=\"https://portal-sentry.swiggyapp.com/settings/swiggy/go-front-staging/keys/\">swiggy.com</a> on your desktop and mobile to realize that), they still have quite a lot of common code interactions.<br /><blockquote>Bike-shedding: Have you tried <a href=\"https://www.swiggy.com?utm_source=medium\">Swiggy</a> website on your desktop or mobile browser? We would love to hear your feedback!</blockquote><h3>The how.</h3><img src=\"/img/blog/1__0WjBWfdkbcob39FMklwp7A.png\" alt=\"Logo of Lerna\"><br /><a href=\"https://lerna.js.org/\">https://lerna.js.org/</a><br />Depending on your ecosystem, there will be different tools to help you with maintaining a Monorepo. You can obviously go vanilla and just use different folders per project. We use <a href=\"https://lerna.js.org/\">Lerna</a> for maintaining our JavaScript codebase.<br />Thanks to its community, there’s a <a href=\"https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/publish\">lot</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/master/FAQ.md\">of</a> <a href=\"https://lerna.js.org/#commands\">documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/mitterio/multirepo-to-lerna-js-monorepo-80f6657cb443\">help</a> for Lerna <a href=\"https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/master/doc/troubleshooting.md\">related</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/master/doc/guides.md\">queries</a>.<br /><pre class=\"code bash\"># Install lerna globally\nnpm i -g lerna\n\n# Change directory to your work folder\ncd ~/Work\n\n# Make the folder you want to keep your monorepo in\nmkdir portal-web\n\n# Change directory to monorepo folder\ncd portal-web\n\n# Initialize lerna (it will handle `git init`)\nlerna init\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit add . && git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;\n\n# Import other packages (https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/import)\nlerna import ~/Work/portal-mweb\n\n# That's pretty much it!\n\n# Fun fact: If you want to rename your package, simply rename the folder before importing.\n# Fun fact 2: You might need to flatten out the commits in most cases (https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/import#--flatten)</pre><br />You may use <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bogas04/874731db80967c040209fea396bf7804\">above scripts</a> to import existing repositories to a lerna based monorepo.<br />Running scripts from the root has been made simpler using these handy <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts\">npm scripts</a>.<br />These scripts allow for convenient way to invoke package scripts from root folder<br />Since our packages are hosted in <a href=\"https://verdaccio.org/\">internal npm registry</a>, we inject a .npmrc in our <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/\">Jenkins</a> build the pipeline to avoid committing the authToken.<br />A script to find all scoped dependencies of a project<br /><pre class=\"code bash\"># Install monorepo dependencies from internal npm registry\nnpm i `../../scripts/scope-packages.js @portal`\n\n# Fun fact:\n# `npm i &lt;package-name&gt;` would also install other dependencies if they aren't present in node_modules,\n# along with the mentioned &lt;package-name&gt;\n\n# Fun fact 2:\n# In presence of package-lock.json, `npm i` would use those version numbers instead of fetching the latest ones\n# This essentially makes it a hybrid of `npm i` and `npm ci`</pre><br />One interesting thing about <a href=\"https://lerna.js.org/\">Lerna</a> is that it <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bogas04/8c9702aba064b03b1162a0058c7b8f98\">doesn’t</a> want private packages to be part of the <code>package-lock.json.</code> This means we can’t just simply use <code>npm ci</code>. We use this bash script to get past that.<h3>The happy part.</h3>Within a few months of making this change, we tippled the number of packages in our Monorepo. We also saw much more work done on the linting front, leading to a more consistent codebase.<br />The linter is common to entire Monorepo, and each new rule affects all the packages.<br /><ul><li><strong>config</strong> (webpack config as a package, reused by mweb and dweb)</li><li><strong>ui</strong> (a package to create common patterns of design to be used in mobile and desktop, thus enabling us to work on creating a Swiggy’s design system)</li><li><strong>payments</strong> (a package of Swiggy’s payments page, used by multiple tenants)</li><li><strong>reviews</strong> (a package of Swiggy’s Ratings and Reviews page and components, used by mweb and dweb)</li><li><strong>helpers</strong> (a package of common reusable logic, something like lodash)</li><li><strong>daily</strong> (swiggydaily.com, reuses 2 components from mweb)</li><li><strong>cache</strong> (a caching module used by mweb and dweb)</li><li><strong>restaurant-url</strong> (a restaurant slug generator, multiple tenants)</li></ul><br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__kvwGrM__62LBXWLHxH__QwGw.png\" alt=\"Image credits: undraw\"><br />I think that giving the option to easily create a new package incentivizes developers to think in more modular terms. They don’t think in the context of an app but rather in a more general way.<br />It also discourages them from touching modules that are used by multiple tenants, and use <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">semantic versioning</a> appropriately.<br />The benefits we are seeing out of this are just amazing:<br /><ul><li>Writing the same fix for dweb and mweb is faster, as it’s just one commit.</li><li>No more <code>npm link</code> mess.</li><li>Reviewing a fix for both dweb and mweb is faster, as it’s just one Pull Request on one repository by one team member.</li><li>Reusing and updating build pipeline is much more seamless.</li><li>Updating major dependencies/lint rules is super easy.</li><li>The collocation of code encourages developers to copy-paste less and reuse more.</li><li>Writing reusable modules becomes easier, leading to better software engineering.</li></ul><h3>The sad part.</h3>But it ain’t all fun. Our PR section is a bit noisier. It’s not like we’re somehow writing more code, but that changes to any package comes to spotlight and doesn’t get silently updated.<br /><ul><li>Too many packages lead to longer bootstrap times.</li><li>Leveraging the benefits of Monorepo takes time.</li><li>The code navigation is slightly slower. Developers are now opening individual packages to work around that.</li></ul><br /><strong>Update:</strong> There’s one more point I would like to touch upon. Our approach currently colocates applications with libraries. ‘mweb’ is a private package in the sense it isn’t published to our npm registry, however ‘ui’ is a public package that can be consumed by mulitple tenants. This leads to heterogeneity in the monorepo. We are okay with this mix as<br /><ul><li>it reduces friction of local development (no npm links).</li><li>colocation leads to easy refactors and library creations.</li><li>code review is simpler when it’s all one repository.</li></ul><h3>The verdict.</h3>So far we’re seeing Monorepo architecture a better fit for our growing codebase and team. It also impacts the way we design new libraries and components, often promoting clearer separations of concerns.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__O3UIYiDjYTXMAZd7GBMwVg.png\" alt=\"Image credits: undraw\"><br />Should you use monorepo? Like all things, it depends on TM! I hope this blog gave enough insight to you as to why we started using a Monorepo, and how it’s benefiting us.<br /><blockquote>DISCLAIMER: We don’t advocate for any of the tools, libraries, coding practices or software development philosophies mentioned here.

Oddly enough, sharing has never worked out well for web, until now (hopefully).</blockquote><h3><h1>History time</h1></h3>Since the social network explosion, ad revenue on page views and obsession with <a href=\"http://digg.com/\">digg</a>\\-ing websites, social sharing “widgets” have polluted our browsing experience with numerous flaws:<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__rW9LubrRX5l06KUeRoCzsA.png\" alt=\"\"><br /><ul><li>They came with a dozen of JavaScript SDK files for every-single-social-network.</li><li>They were usually “sticky”, because that’s so cool.</li><li>They were hard to style, always looking pretty off from your website’s look and feel.</li><li>They almost always lacked one social network which was big in your region or for your audience.</li></ul><br />All these flaws became more prominent with rise of smartphones. SDKs burdened (and <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-16-of-the-code-on-the-average-site-belongs-to-facebook-and-what-that-means-68956cd731be\">still do</a>) the network and CPU, “sticky” widgets janked scrolling, and became unsurprisingly <a href=\"http://thinksem.com/blog/floating-social-media-share-bar-good-or-bad/\">very annoying</a> at smaller resolutions (like they weren’t otherwise). And they certainly weren’t meant for everyone.<br />While solutions like lazy-loading and simpler designs helped a lot, it still is a painful job to find the right widget for your website, tweak it till the point it isn’t an eye-sore, only to find out that the users aren’t digg-ing it anymore (shameless pun-intended), and want to share it on XYZ messenger, which doesn’t have an <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/28000012\">intent</a> URL yet.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__4xpPKwDeI__BomsMMRntRTw.png\" alt=\"1990s called and it wants you to reply back.\">\n1990s called and it wants you to reply back.<br />Sadly, browsers haven’t cared enough to innovate much in this space lately. There were several attempts by Mozilla, Chrome and even <a href=\"http://www.lovemysurface.net/using-windows-8-share-charm-surface/\">Windows 8</a>. While they still let you “email” your website on Desktop, and share to your favorite app on mobile, but that’s about it. Developer has no control over the shared title, content or the URL, which is a bigger problem when we talk about SPAs with fancy URLs.<h3><h1>tl;dr</h1></h3>And this changes with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/09/navigator-share\">Web Share API</a>. Wow, that’s quite a lot of build up for a simple API, isn’t it ? But this API is remarkable !<br />And that’s it !

Which means, in next 6 weeks, this API would be available on almost every other Android phone.

I believe that it’s basically the result of negative-feedback in my brain. Sounds weird right? I’ll explain.<h3>Before</h3>I’ll first go through initial state variables;<br /><ul><li>Age: 22 years and 9 months</li><li>Weight: 87 kilograms | 191 pounds</li><li>Height: 174 centimeters | 5 feet 8.5 inches</li><li>Waist: 91 centimeters | 36 inches</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi-m.htm\">BMI</a>: 28.7 (Overweight, 4 kilograms from being obese)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.health-calc.com/body-composition/waist-to-height-ratio\">Waist to Height</a>: 0.52 (Males at increased risk)</li><li>Vegetarian? ✔</li><li>Very low sugar intake? ✔</li><li>Significant workout throughout the day? ✗</li></ul><br />Depending on where you come from, this might not look bad enough, and which was the exact attitude that kept me from doing anything significant about it (and I never did!). I tried the gym, but I always felt it wasn’t quite a sustainable solution, I wanted something that I could do in my daily routine.<br />It’s like, you can starve for 2 months and lose plenty, but that one day when you decide to eat something good, you just lose your control. Similarly, you might work out well for 2 months, but a long vacation to grandma’s might be enough to make you lousy again. These are very fragile methods in my opinion, for my sort of lifestyle in which work, commute, <em>\\<em>cough\\* Netflix<em> take most of the time.<h3>The Change</h3>So what started the chain of events was this app called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness\">Google Fit</em></em></em></a>. It’s a basic fitness app that uses your phone sensors to calculate steps/calories burnt/distance covered. That’s pretty much it.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__WFkALvcY68HD__PaoixgiiQ.png\" alt=\"23rd of February is when I installed the app, though it took 3 days to get me to work on my goal.\">\n23rd of February is when I installed the app, though it took 3 days to get me to work on my goal.<br />Annnnd I forgot about it for three days. I opened it one day to see that I actually completed the goal of 10,000 steps on a Saturday when I went for a walk by the lake. That was easy! What I also observed was that I roughly burnt 1,700 ~ 2,000 calories by doing nothing throughout the day. Even if the data isn’t accurate, the sensor and environment conditions remain the same, making it a reliable way to observe variations and not the absolute values.<br />My brain was intrigued by these numbers. It’s almost how you add hashtags to Instagram posts to get more likes, and once you do get more, you overdo it, and the cycle continues. Just that, here you get likes from health!<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__EmZytUAuspI__mycZ__o9OGw.png\" alt=\"VERY TECHNICAL. MUCH SCIENCE.\">\nVERY TECHNICAL. MUCH SCIENCE.<br />So the first thing I did was that I <em>reduced the goal to 9,000 steps</em> to make myself feel better. And every week I increased it by 500–1000 steps as and when I started getting a good rhythm.<br />The other thing that I did was that I took interest in knowing calories of things I ate daily. By learning that a spoon of oil has as many calories as a bowl of corn flakes, which in turn has as many calories as a can of cola, I somehow started making food at home to avoid the extra cheese/butter/oil the chefs put in.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__UFCQ__sve25zCXqzQc__rYxA.png\" alt=\"Remember, one is a breakfast, one is a drink with a snack, and other is added to your lunch just like that!\">\nRemember, one is a breakfast, one is a drink with a snack, and other is added to your lunch just like that!<br />Again, didn’t intend to, it’s just my brain trying to optimize calorie intake.<br />Not only I became more aware of the calories that I put it, I also started reducing them by simply cooking at home with better alternatives.<br />This number was insightful in an indirect way. Knowing that I was burning say 2000 calories daily, by ensuring low-calorie diet (without compromises), and burning more than the usual 2000, there was no way for me to not lose weight. And I did.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__7emoMCCIFij0dncEASB94g.gif\" alt=\"MILLIONS OF CALORIES\">\nMILLIONS OF CALORIES<br />Losing weight is really no rocket-science. Either take in lesser calories or burn more than you eat or BOTH!<br />Adding to these two numbers, I also bought a nice digital weighing scale, only to get depressed every morning, which again helped me complete those extra 500 steps or choose fruits overs chips for snacks.<br />So to summarize, all I did was;<br /><ul><li>Ensure I complete my steps daily, and increase them ever-so-slightly every week. I stopped increasing beyond 15,000 steps though.</li><li>Count calories of random food that I regularly ate, and replaced with better non-processed alternatives.</li><li>Eat out less often.</li><li>Check my weight regularly. The more aware I became of how previous day’s activity resulted in lower weight, the more my brain took it as a reward and probably released <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin\">Oxytocin</a> to give a sense of contentment and incompleteness at the same time.

I simply increased my steps for those days or did extra steps later. Basically, I didn’t change my lifestyle at all, apart from dedicating 2–3 hours to walk and cooking daily.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__B3QKpZdPXxmFaDsc9XQbdg.png\" alt=\"I meet my goals daily, and compensate whenever I eat outside.\">\nI meet my goals daily, and compensate whenever I eat outside.<br />So by minor changes in my lifestyle, I found myself becoming less lethargic, which only helped me improve it more and more. I could work for long hours, walk for 2 hours, then cook food and still feel active!<br />Over time, I also found myself leaning towards a vegan diet. Watching <a href=\"http://www.cowspiracy.com/\">Cowspiracy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whatthehealthfilm.com/\">What the Health</a> helped me with it greatly. I still have milk in coffee (creamer as it’s called in the west) & ice creams on some days though. Still working on it. YouTube Channels like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/rawvegannotgross\">Raw. Vegan. Not Gross</a> & <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEjkioV3LO_OIUaSWRxFZ3A\">Cheap Lazy Vegan</a> help me a lot with non-dairy experiments. It’s simply unavailability of vegan alternatives in India that make me lose to coffee creamer.<br />Some clarifications I want to make here;<br /><ul><li>I didn’t starve. I just ate better alternatives. I still had plenty of cheat days, but with reduced quantities and compensation for same.</li><li>I didn’t exhaust myself. Walking is the most basic exercise which is good for general health and doesn’t quite focus on any one body part. I lost weight not only from my calves & thighs, but also from my face, arms, and waist. I also did push-ups to ensure muscle growth in torso region.</li><li>Girls are still not interested in me. Sigh.</li><li>Men on other hand compliment, saying I’ve become leaner. PROFIT???</li></ul><br />As always, it worked for me, but might not work for you. However, I’ve seen people reduce weight just by, say, getting rid of sugar, or meat, or dairy. In my case, these were already pretty much absent. Apparently, dieting wasn’t enough to pull this off alone, which is why I believe basic exercise like walking together with a better diet helped me overall. My advice would be to not look at long term gains, but to compare between days and weeks.<br />My quest is still on. I intend to sit in the middle of the ideal BMI range, and also improve on my Vegan skills.<br />Here’s a before (Feb 2017, 87kg | 192lb) & after (Oct 2017, 69kg | 152 lb) picture.<br /><blockquote><strong>Update Nov 2017:</strong> I lost even more weight since the time I posted this blog, about 3–4 kgs (6.6–8.8 lbs). And I also turned full vegan.</blockquote><br />PS:<br /><ul><li>BMI and other such metrics have flaws. Don’t be too serious about them.</li><li>Losing weight doesn’t always mean better health. Consult a dietitian or whatever.</li><li>Feel free to analyze my case & give remarks.</li></ul>"},{"title":"Release of Samsung Internet Chrome Extension v2","description":"","Update Oct 2017":"Since the release of v2 (March 2017), we saw a 9.3x increasein our monthly active users (~8k to 75k).

I’ll walk-through the new additions in the article.<br /><blockquote>Drastic improvements to first-sync performance.</blockquote><br />First-sync performance was the number one complaint in our web store reviews, usually leaving users to never actually getting around to use our extension. We hit the heart of the issue with a dagger by rewriting several modules and chaining network requests, database queries and DOM updates in a much more optimized manner. With this release, you can now not only see the progress of sync, but also the fetched bookmarks as and when they arrive. We feel this will solve the top complaint and allow users to enjoy the extension.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__qYPi94TVyTF1p1aX1BCW9g.gif\" alt=\"\"><br /><blockquote>Consistent UI with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser\">Samsung Internet on Android.</a></blockquote><br />We are proud of our UX team’s efforts in offering a very modern look and feel to the extension. The small 600 x 400 screen real estate makes it much harder to add features while keeping the interface user-friendly. After several iterations, I think we’ve pretty much nailed it. From a progress bar to show sync status to modals for bookmark management, the UI even though offering several functionalities doesn’t overwhelm the user.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__hE8PGhNMYIhyt3WsuEF50Q.png\" alt=\"Live loading of bookmarks, top requested feature.\">\nLive loading of bookmarks, top requested feature.<br /><blockquote>Enhanced bookmark management.</blockquote><br />The previous version (1.4) was bit limiting in the sense users could only edit title or delete a bookmark. We felt that the extension can offer much more than that and with today’s release, not only basic create / update / delete / move is supported, but users can also import Chrome bookmarks into their Samsung account. We feel that this brings the control back to the user.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__d6bWg__Yhi2DyDM0JSZdrjA.png\" alt=\"Improved Bookmark Management\">\nImproved Bookmark Management<br /><blockquote>And much more…</blockquote><br />The feature list just doesn’t stop here ! Some of the other miscellaneous changes:<br /><ul><li>Context menu support to bookmark current tab with a single click.</li></ul>\n  <em>Pro tip: You can use</em> <strong><em>Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Y</em></strong> <em>combination to bookmark instantly.</em><ul><li>Improved internationalization for supported languages.</li><li>Improved keyboard accessibility, you can tab your way through all items.</li></ul><br /><blockquote><strong>Update April 2017:</strong> Version 2.0.5 is now released to Chrome Web Store that fixes login related issues faced by certain users with the previous version (2.0.3).</blockquote><br />Let us know if you run into issues, or just want to give us some feedback.

Before starting off my engineering career, I’d developed horrible Visual Basic applications and knew exactly what I wanted to do in my life; create <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5LzH2sh1rk\">stupid</a> UIs with no knowledge of design. After joining the college, I made a very sane unintentional decision of learning JavaScript to make websites/webapps. Back then, JavaScript wasn’t even looked upon as a serious language, NodeJS was in its baby years of popularity, and using jQuery was cool. But I don’t know why, I kept coding in it. And this very thing and some luck landed me up in a summer internship at Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore where I worked on a NodeJS project. And that lead me to,,, wait, I need to start a Samsung heading.<h3>Samsung</h3><img src=\"/img/blog/1____g5l9BybNJiUO22dNPEeYg.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Digital City, Suwon\">\nSamsung Digital City, Suwon<br />Yeah, so that lead me to a full time job at SRIB, which again lead me to Suwon, the place where HQ of Samsung Electronics resides. I’m part of Web Team in SRIB, that is also responsible for <a href=\"https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev\">Samsung Internet</a>, and I am currently overhauling the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/samsung-sync/epejdmjgfibjaffbmojllapapjejipkh?hl=en\">Samsung Sync extension</a>. Expect a major update soon!<br />It’s funny how the ship of JavaScript sailed me across from one island to another. And now, I’m typing this from Suwon as my last week of business trip is about to start.<br />I love the wide range of technologies that exist within Samsung Electronics. This provides a great canvas for freshers to try and experiment with all domains without having to switch jobs.<h3>Korea</h3>This last week has brought several memories of this 2 month stay in Korea, which in turn encouraged me to write this post on a Sunday evening.<br /><img src=\"/img/blog/1__ng__tz1ZRfUcuEaSPWdKFdQ.jpeg\" alt=\"Somewhere in Suwon\">\nSomewhere in Suwon<br />The country is amazing, it’s a developed nation, which is a thing a citizen of a developing nation would observe first.
