What I also observed was that I roughly burnt 1,700 ~ 2,000 calories by doing nothing throughout the day. Even if the data isn’t accurate, the sensor and environment conditions remain the same, making it a reliable way to observe variations and not the absolute values.\u003cbr /\u003eMy brain was intrigued by these numbers. It’s almost how you add hashtags to Instagram posts to get more likes, and once you do get more, you overdo it, and the cycle continues. Just that, here you get likes from health!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/blog/1__EmZytUAuspI__mycZ__o9OGw.png\" alt=\"VERY TECHNICAL. MUCH SCIENCE.\"\u003e\nVERY TECHNICAL.

And every week I increased it by 500–1000 steps as and when I started getting a good rhythm.\u003cbr /\u003eThe other thing that I did was that I took interest in knowing calories of things I ate daily. By learning that a spoon of oil has as many calories as a bowl of corn flakes, which in turn has as many calories as a can of cola, I somehow started making food at home to avoid the extra cheese/butter/oil the chefs put in.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/blog/1__UFCQ__sve25zCXqzQc__rYxA.png\" alt=\"Remember, one is a breakfast, one is a drink with a snack, and other is added to your lunch just like that!\"\u003e\nRemember, one is a breakfast, one is a drink with a snack, and other is added to your lunch just like that!\u003cbr /\u003eAgain, didn’t intend to, it’s just my brain trying to optimize calorie intake.\u003cbr /\u003eNot only I became more aware of the calories that I put it, I also started reducing them by simply cooking at home with better alternatives.\u003cbr /\u003eThis number was insightful in an indirect way.
