There was an ideological difference between Prahlad and his father. His father felt superior and he felt that he was worthy of worship. This inflated self-view was further exemplified by the fact that his province \u0026#x26; society agreed, thanks to his boon of invincibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/blog/prahlad-2.jpg\" alt=\"Prahlad in lap of his angry father\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrahlad, on other hand, by grace of his own wisdom given by Narad, believed Vishnu to be his God.

The same applies to a team of employees. If every problem requires another employee to stop what they're doing and help you out, it causes a pipeline stall. Because they've stalled what they were doing, dependents of their work would also be stalled. It isn't immediately obvious, but as the team scales without adopting asynchronous communication, productivity counter-intuitively decreases, despite the increase of workforce. In my opinion addition of new members doesn't also mean improvement of efficient communication amongst them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/blog/asynchronous-vs-synchronous.png\" alt=\"Image comparing how synchronously processes stall the pipeline while asynchronous processes do not do so\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake it easy for other person to reply quickly, for example:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA yes/no question can be answered faster than an ambiguous monologue.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eScheduling a meeting in advance (after checking their calendar) is better than asking \"are you free?\" and waiting for hours.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSharing relevant details/attachments is better than waiting for them to ask you for that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSharing a deadline in your ask gives other person time to organize their week plans better.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExpect delays in replies, that's the norm, not an exception.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeep some extra chores at hand while you wait for a reply, so as to not stay blocked until you receive one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"clear-articulate-communication\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#clear-articulate-communication\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e🔗 \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eClear Articulate Communication\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffective written communication becomes critical the more companies embrace remote work.

The first message is essentially a \u003ca href=\"https://chelseatroy.com/2018/04/17/but-what-if-i-cannot-tap-my-remote-employee-on-the-shoulder/\"\u003eshoulder tap equivalent of office\u003c/a\u003e. You completely break the flow of the other person, without being considerate about their time and their context switch. Please don't do this unless it's basically EMERGENT as well as URGENT. To understand the difference between the two, let's look at this quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main difference between emergency and urgency is that in emergency there is immediate threat to life, health, property or environment; whereas in urgency, there is no immediate danger or threat to life, health, property or environment but if not taken care in a given period of time, then the situation may turn into an emergency situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.differencebetween.net/science/nature/difference-between-urgence-and-emergency/\"\u003eSource\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope we can all agree that first message should ONLY be reserved for emergencies. If we keep crying foul, like calling a person to help with an unreleased software or upcoming demo, what eventually happens is that employees lose seriousness and start skipping calls. This can be catastrophic when you really have an emergency, like a huge outage or critical crash that's costing millions of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we've established that the first message is basically reserved for emergencies, let's see why the second message isn't ideal either. The problem is that it's focused only in getting the solution, but with minimum effort. It's basically like asking someone to take over and fix your issue, i.e. \u003ca href=\"https://theleegroup.com/spoon-fed-vs-supportive-management/\"\u003espoon feeding\u003c/a\u003e.

React Applications. JSX is basically an extension to JavaScript to add support for XML like syntax. While JSX isn't necessary, it does make it much more easy to write code. React's philosophy deviates from traditional template based frameworks (Angular, Vue, Svelte) in the sense that it doesn't mix programming constructs into the template, but rather mixes HTML into JavaScript itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes writing UI code familiar to HTML, while also having access to entire JavaScript syntax. This IMO reduces a lot of boilerplate and template specific knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: A tool like babel or typescript can be used to do this transformation. Note, as it is JSX won't run on browser, it needs to be converted to JavaScript, hence the need of a build tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"remark-highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"language-tsx\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-tsx\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e\u0026#x3C;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token class-name\"\u003eMyComponent\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token attr-name\"\u003eisActive\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e;\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"token comment\"\u003e// is transpiled into\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"token maybe-class-name\"\u003eReact\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token method function property-access\"\u003ecreateElement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token maybe-class-name\"\u003eMyComponent\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e isActive\u003cspan class=\"token operator\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token boolean\"\u003etrue\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e;\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e\u0026#x3C;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token class-name\"\u003eMyComponent\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token attr-name\"\u003eisActive\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token spread\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token attr-value\"\u003eprops\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e;\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"token comment\"\u003e// is loosely transpiled into\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"token maybe-class-name\"\u003eReact\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token method function property-access\"\u003ecreateElement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token maybe-class-name\"\u003eMyComponent\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e isActive\u003cspan class=\"token operator\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token boolean\"\u003etrue\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token spread operator\"\u003e...\u003c/span\u003eprops \u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003e;\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-react-component\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-react-component\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e🔗 \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eA React component\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we know how to express UI in a React app efficiently (code readability wise), we can look into an actual React component now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 3 primary parts to a React component.

fundamental difference in idea of state in a class component and functional component. In a class component, entire state is part of \u003ccode\u003ethis.state\u003c/code\u003e and each state variable would be a key of it. While in functional component, each state variable is created individually by virtue of \u003ccode\u003euseState\u003c/code\u003e, a magical-looking function that somehow remembers current state value between renders, and can differentiate one from another. You can also see how state is tightly coupled to the class (it's directly inside the constructor), while in case of function, it is yet another function call. If say you had 3 state variables, you can group 3 \u003ccode\u003euseState\u003c/code\u003es in one function call and use it. This isn't quite intuitively obvious when we see class based components.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, we only had class based components as the only viable option as only they supported state and other features. However, React introduced concept of \u003ca href=\"http://reactjs.org/hooks\"\u003ehooks\u003c/a\u003e (such as \u003ccode\u003euseState\u003c/code\u003e), that gives a lot of flexibility to functional components making them not only on-par but actually superior in terms of code re-usability and agility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince it's much simpler to understand functional components, we'll go through them first so that you can contribute ASAP. When we discuss lifecycle methods, we'll learn more about the differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/stoic-ptolemy-n2h8r?fontsize=14\u0026hidenavigation=1\u0026theme=dark\"\n  style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n  title=\"stoic-ptolemy-n2h8r\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n  sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"lifecycles-and-side-effects\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#lifecycles-and-side-effects\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e🔗 \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLifecycles and Side-effects\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving access to state and props is very powerful to create dynamic UIs. However, you also need to know about the lifecycle of a component. You may want to call an API as soon as the UI is visible to user. Or may want to cancel a polling request as soon as the component is removed from current tree of components. You may want to know when a \u003ccode\u003equery\u003c/code\u003e prop has been updated by a parent of a \u003ccode\u003e\u0026#x3C;Search query={userQuery} /\u003e\u003c/code\u003e component, to fetch new results based on updated \u003ccode\u003equery\u003c/code\u003e. All these are side effects of component's life cycle. Perform this side effect when some event occurs (component loads, state changes, prop changes, component unloads to name a few).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's see how to listen to these events in

more lifecycle methods provided by React.Component, but I think these 3 are enough for you to build highly dynamic UIs that are memory safe. They're quite powerful and let you know achieve a lot of complex interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, remember I told how class based components are tightly coupled to the business logic and are hence quite verbose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLogic to call API whenever a component loads seems to be a generic problem, but due to the way React classes are designed, it's hard to abstract this out in a neat way. There are several advanced patterns like Render Props and Higher Order Functions to mitigate that. Each time you want to call an API on load of a component, you've to write this logic in one way or another.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSince we can define \u003ccode\u003ecomponentDidMount\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ecomponentDidUpdate\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ecomponentWillUnmount\u003c/code\u003e only once, they'll keep the logic to call APIs, unsubscribe from intervals and subscriptions, clean up other resources in a one huge block. We can't really abstract it out as they're all interdependent. In our timer example, we need to rely on \u003ccode\u003ecomponentDidMount\u003c/code\u003e to set \u003ccode\u003ethis.timer\u003c/code\u003e so that we can clear it in \u003ccode\u003ecomponentWillUnmount\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe logic to check which prop has been updated can quickly become a mess if you've to listen to changes on multiple props.

So we can see that ReactJS (class components, state, lifecycle, props, composability, hooks etc.) is actually host platform agnostic. It can run on any platform as long as you provide a driver for the same. On Native platforms, \u003ca href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\"\u003ereact-native\u003c/a\u003e does that. You can image that we can't use \u003ccode\u003eh1\u003c/code\u003e and the like on native as they don't understand HTML. Instead, we've things like \u003ccode\u003eTextView\u003c/code\u003e on Android and \u003ccode\u003eUITextView\u003c/code\u003e on iOS and so on for all native UI elements.

There's one more difference however, and that is styling:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJust like native platforms don't understand HTML, they don't understand CSS either.

Strings are only accepted by \u003ccode\u003e\u0026#x3C;Text/\u003e\u003c/code\u003e and you can't place strings inside a \u003ccode\u003e\u0026#x3C;View /\u003e\u003c/code\u003e, similarly rules around text (color, fontSize etc) don't have any effect on a \u003ccode\u003e\u0026#x3C;View /\u003e\u003c/code\u003e.

solve. Render props are just a fancy name given to a pattern in which makes use of the fact that \u003ccode\u003echildren\u003c/code\u003e field (or any prop for that matter) of a component can actually be a function. Using this, we can put behavior in our Render Prop accepting Component and use it like any other React Component. This is in a way inversion of control, where you decide what you want to render. For an example, let's modify the first class based example of loading data on component load. This helps us extract the behavior out of our initial example and lets us reuse that logic wherever we want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"remark-highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre

See, each time reference of state or props of a component changes, React would re-render the component. This is how we achieve reactivity.

help in that case. To memoize the value, in functional components we can use advanced hooks like \u003ccode\u003eReact.useMemo\u003c/code\u003e \u0026#x26; \u003ccode\u003eReact.useCallback\u003c/code\u003e. Suppose we really need to pass \u003ccode\u003eversion\u003c/code\u003e as a data object. We can ask React to memoize it between renders using \u003ccode\u003euseMemo\u003c/code\u003e. The second argument is a dependency array, just like \u003ccode\u003euseEffect\u003c/code\u003e. So here we are telling React to recompute \u003ccode\u003elibraryData\u003c/code\u003e whenver any item in the array passed as second argument changes. Empty array implies on component mount.

them only if you've an actual performance regression. More often than not, the extra work done in these optimizations might give very little gains with the cost of code complexity and potential to introduce bugs. Each memoization technique described here requries extra computation (\u003ccode\u003eReact.memo\u003c/code\u003e loops throught all props and checks their reference change), memory usage (To memoize is to store data) between renders, so the benefit would only come if the value you're trying to memozie is too expensive to calculate (some highly complicated data manipulation on an array of 1000 items) or the component you're planning to prevent re-renders for has a complicated deeply nested UI to render. In above cases it makes no sense as \u003ccode\u003e\u0026#x3C;h1 /\u003e\u003c/code\u003e is fairly simple component and \u003ccode\u003elibraryData\u003c/code\u003e is a very small object.

ways than \u003ccode\u003eReact.memo\u003c/code\u003e. Firstly, it has access to \u003ccode\u003enextState\u003c/code\u003e so we can add checks for state changes. This can be helpful if a key in \u003ccode\u003ethis.state\u003c/code\u003e is an object or function and you can't determine whether a state update is needed whenever you set it. Secondly, it is expecting answer to \u003ccode\u003eshould component update?\u003c/code\u003e and not \u003ccode\u003eare props the same?\u003c/code\u003e. Other than that it's pretty much the same. You can imagine writing it by hand and having a dozen of checks for a large component can be tedious and error-prone. If only we had a default behaviour of \u003ccode\u003eReact.memo\u003c/code\u003e for classes. Enter \u003ccode\u003eReact.PureComponent\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like \u003ccode\u003eReact.Component\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eReact.PureComponent\u003c/code\u003e is another class you can extend from to create your component. It behaves just like a regular component, but has a \u003ccode\u003eshouldComponentUpdate\u003c/code\u003e lifecycle method implemented for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

It’s a basic fitness app that uses your phone sensors to calculate steps/calories burnt/distance covered. That’s pretty much it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/blog/1__WFkALvcY68HD__PaoixgiiQ.png\" alt=\"23rd of February is when I installed the app, though it took 3 days to get me to work on my goal.\"\u003e\n23rd of February is when I installed the app, though it took 3 days to get me to work on my goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnnnd I forgot about it for three days. I opened it one day to see that I actually completed the goal of 10,000 steps on a Saturday when I went for a walk by the lake. That was easy! What I also observed was that I roughly burnt 1,700 ~ 2,000 calories by doing nothing throughout the day. Even if the data isn’t accurate, the sensor and environment conditions remain the same, making it a reliable way to observe variations and not the absolute values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain was intrigued by these numbers. It’s almost how you add hashtags to Instagram posts to get more likes, and once you do get more, you overdo it, and the cycle continues. Just that, here you get likes from health!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/blog/1__EmZytUAuspI__mycZ__o9OGw.png\" alt=\"VERY TECHNICAL. MUCH SCIENCE.\"\u003e\nVERY TECHNICAL.

And every week I increased it by 500–1000 steps as and when I started getting a good rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other thing that I did was that I took interest in knowing calories of things I ate daily. By learning that a spoon of oil has as many calories as a bowl of corn flakes, which in turn has as many calories as a can of cola, I somehow started making food at home to avoid the extra cheese/butter/oil the chefs put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/blog/1__UFCQ__sve25zCXqzQc__rYxA.png\" alt=\"Remember, one is a breakfast, one is a drink with a snack, and other is added to your lunch just like that!\"\u003e\nRemember, one is a breakfast, one is a drink with a snack, and other is added to your lunch just like that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, didn’t intend to, it’s just my brain trying to optimize calorie intake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only I became more aware of the calories that I put it, I also started reducing them by simply cooking at home with better alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis number was insightful in an indirect way. Knowing that I was burning say 2000 calories daily, by ensuring low-calorie diet (without compromises), and burning more than the usual 2000, there was no way for me to not lose weight.

At the same time I also went to grandma’s house (= fat rich food), ate out and ate heavy items (= too many calories), and even fall ill (= very little walk).
