It can also be hard to remember to update all elements that are related to one particular state variable.</li>\n<li>Let's take example of an app like Swiggy. When I click on add item, see how many elements update, and how many calculations are going on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not just that, there are a lot of edge cases that have to be handled. Observe what happens when I try to add item from other restaurant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly manually updating each state variable and element is invitation to a messy codebase. And we've not yet seen how hard it can be to update UI code.</li>\n<li>For something as simple as updating text of any element, we've to do the following. Imagine having id's all over your HTML code and writing code to manually mutate every single field, each time one state variable changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><pre><code><span>// pseudo-ish code, just to illustrate how one might tackle the problem</span>\n<span>// with imperative procedural approach</span>\n\n<span>const</span> addToCart <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>\"add-to-cart\"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n\naddToCart<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>\"click\"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>getCartRestaurant</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>!==</span> <span>getCurrentRestaurant</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>showPopup</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>return</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>}</span>\n\n  e<span>.</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>innerText</span> <span>=</span> e<span>.</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>innerText</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>\n\n  <span>const</span> itemDetails <span>=</span> itemStore<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>addToCart<span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>itemId</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cartExists</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>addCartToUI</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// series of commands to build up cart UI</span>\n    <span>addItemToCartUI</span><span>(</span>itemDetails<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// series of commands to update cart UI with new itemDetails</span>\n  <span>}</span>\n\n  <span>addItemToCartUI</span><span>(</span>itemDetails<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>This is where React comes handy by abstracting the imperative commands in a declarative API, while also making it reactive to state changes. So whenever our state changes, React will take care of updating the UI as defined by our code.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&#x3C;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>addItemToCartState</span><span>(</span>itemDetails<span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>></span></span><span>Add</span><span><span><span>&#x3C;/</span>button</span><span>></span></span><span>;</span>\n<span>{</span>\n  cartExists <span>&#x26;&#x26;</span> <span><span><span>&#x3C;</span><span>Cart</span></span> <span>items</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>cart<span>.</span><span>items</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/></span></span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n<span>{</span>\n  cartExists <span>&#x26;&#x26;</span> currentRestaurant <span>!==</span> cart<span>.</span><span>restaurant</span> <span>&#x26;&#x26;</span> <span><span><span>&#x3C;</span><span>Popup</span></span> <span>/></span></span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>React takes care of rendering to UI, we just need to make update cart state, the components would react to it naturally. By making reusable components like Cart and Popup, you don't have to duplicate code each time you want to construct UI and behavior around it. Components can naturally compose making it really easy to write code.</li>\n<li>React Native is another platform that uses React in its core. All fundamentals of React are ditto same in React Native, with only differences in some APIs and core components provided. The value proposition of React Native is that unlike native apps, you can use single codebase for iOS, Android and Web, while also bypassing App store/Play store for releasing non-native changes (all UI &#x26; business logic majorly). We'll discuss this point later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-jsx---the-language-of-react\"><a href=\"#jsx---the-language-of-react\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>JSX - The language of React</h2>\n<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span><span>React</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>\"react\"</span><span>;</span>\n\n<span>function</span> <span><span>Person</span></span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>\n    <span><span><span>&#x3C;</span>div</span><span>></span></span><span></span>\n<span>      </span><span><span><span>&#x3C;</span>h1</span> <span>style</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>\"red\"</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span></span><span>></span></span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&#x3C;/</span>h1</span><span>></span></span><span></span>\n<span>    </span><span><span><span>&#x3C;/</span>div</span><span>></span></span>\n  <span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n\n<span>// is transpiled into</span>\n\n<span>import</span> <span><span>React</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>\"react\"</span><span>;</span>\n\n<span>function</span> <span><span>Person</span></span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>return</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span>\n    <span>\"div\"</span><span>,</span>\n    <span>null</span><span>,</span>\n    <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>\"h1\"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>style</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>\"red\"</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> props<span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>\n  <span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Before we understand React, we must first take time to understand JSX, the way you describe UI in React Applications. JSX is basically an extension to JavaScript to add support for XML like syntax. While JSX isn't necessary, it does make it much more easy to write code. React's philosophy deviates from traditional template based frameworks (Angular, Vue, Svelte) in the sense that it doesn't mix programming constructs into the template, but rather mixes HTML into JavaScript itself.</p>\n<p>This makes writing UI code familiar to HTML, while also having access to entire JavaScript syntax. This IMO reduces a lot of boilerplate and template specific knowledge.</p>\n<p>Note: A tool like babel or typescript can be used to do this transformation. Note, as it is JSX won't run on browser, it needs to be converted to JavaScript, hence the need of a build tool.</p>\n<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&#x3C;</span><span>MyComponent</span></span> <span>isActive</span> <span>/></span></span><span>;</span>\n<span>// is transpiled into</span>\n<span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>MyComponent</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> isActive<span>:</span> <span>true</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n\n<span><span><span>&#x3C;</span><span>MyComponent</span></span> <span>isActive</span> <span><span>{</span><span>...</span>props<span>}</span></span> <span>/></span></span><span>;</span>\n<span>// is loosely transpiled into</span>\n<span>React</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>MyComponent</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> isActive<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span>props <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-a-react-component\"><a href=\"#a-react-component\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>A React component</h2>\n<p>Now that we know how to express UI in a React app efficiently (code readability wise), we can look into an actual React component now.</p>\n<p>There are 3 primary parts to a React component.

In a class component, entire state is part of <code>this.state</code> and each state variable would be a key of it. While in functional component, each state variable is created individually by virtue of <code>useState</code>, a magical-looking function that somehow remembers current state value between renders, and can differentiate one from another. You can also see how state is tightly coupled to the class (it's directly inside the constructor), while in case of function, it is yet another function call. If say you had 3 state variables, you can group 3 <code>useState</code>s in one function call and use it. This isn't quite intuitively obvious when we see class based components.</p>\n<p>Originally, we only had class based components as the only viable option as only they supported state and other features. However, React introduced concept of <a href=\"http://reactjs.org/hooks\">hooks</a> (such as <code>useState</code>), that gives a lot of flexibility to functional components making them not only on-par but actually superior in terms of code re-usability and agility.</p>\n<p>Since it's much simpler to understand functional components, we'll go through them first so that you can contribute ASAP. When we discuss lifecycle methods, we'll learn more about the differences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-lifecycles-and-side-effects\"><a href=\"#lifecycles-and-side-effects\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>Lifecycles and Side-effects</h3>\n<p>Having access to state and props is very powerful to create dynamic UIs. However, you also need to know about the lifecycle of a component. You may want to call an API as soon as the UI is visible to user. Or may want to cancel a polling request as soon as the component is removed from current tree of components. You may want to know when a <code>query</code> prop has been updated by a parent of a <code>&#x3C;Search query={userQuery} /></code> component, to fetch new results based on updated <code>query</code>. All these are side effects of component's life cycle. Perform this side effect when some event occurs (component loads, state changes, prop changes, component unloads to name a few).</p>\n<p>Let's see how to listen to these events in class based components first.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-class-based-components\"><a href=\"#class-based-components\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>Class Based Components</h3>\n<h4

are memory safe. They're quite powerful and let you know achieve a lot of complex interactions.</p>\n<p>However, remember I told how class based components are tightly coupled to the business logic and are hence quite verbose?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logic to call API whenever a component loads seems to be a generic problem, but due to the way React classes are designed, it's hard to abstract this out in a neat way. There are several advanced patterns like Render Props and Higher Order Functions to mitigate that. Each time you want to call an API on load of a component, you've to write this logic in one way or another.</li>\n<li>Since we can define <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code> and <code>componentWillUnmount</code> only once, they'll keep the logic to call APIs, unsubscribe from intervals and subscriptions, clean up other resources in a one huge block. We can't really abstract it out as they're all interdependent. In our timer example, we need to rely on <code>componentDidMount</code> to set <code>this.timer</code> so that we can clear it in <code>componentWillUnmount</code>.</li>\n<li>The logic to check which prop has been updated can quickly become a mess if you've to listen to changes on multiple props. What we really want to do is \"whenever props.query changes, do this\" but what we're actually doing is \"whenever component updates, check if it updated due to change in query, if that's the case, do this\". Also, since <code>componentDidUpdate</code> isn't fired when component is loaded, we need to perform the call in <code>componentDidMount</code> as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-functional-components\"><a href=\"#functional-components\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>Functional Components</h3>\n<p>Now that we've seen the power of lifecycle methods, let's see how functional components achieve that with basically making use <code>useEffect</code>. As you can imagine, <code>useEffect</code> seems to be a hook doing a lot of heavy lifting, so let's spend some time understanding it before going through above use cases.</p>\n<p>Let's first see the signature of <code>useEffect</code>.</p>\n<div><pre><code><span>// a function returning nothing</span>\n<span>type</span> <span>CleanupType</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>void</span><span>;</span>\n<span>// a function returning a CleanupType function</span>\n<span>type</span> <span>CallbackType</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>CleanupType</span><span>;</span>\n\n<span>// accepts CallbackType function and Dependency array, returns nothing</span>\n<span>type</span> <span>UseEffectType</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>CallbackType</span><span>,</span> <span>Dependency</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>void</span><span>;</span>\n\n<span>// example</span>\n\n<span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>doSomethingElse</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>,</span> <span>[</span>a<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In above example, we are basically asking react to <code>doSomething</code> whenever <code>a</code> changes (dependency list tells react to listen to changes on that variable). And whenever <code>a</code> transitions from one value to another, before considering the new value, call <code>doSomethingElse</code>. This can be seen as an opportunity to do cleanup. Clear polling functions, unsubscribing event listeners, saving some state to storage etc.</p>\n<p>An empty dependency list would imply whenever the component that has invoked this hook mounted and unmounted. If you omit the dependency list altogether, then you're essentially telling React to run your code on each render. You almost never want this.</p>\n<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n\n  <span>// is loosely same as</span>\n  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We can already see how the hooks aren't tied to the functional component that is invoking them, and that we can have multiple number of <code>useEffect</code>s, just like <code>useState</code>. Lastly, it's just a function call, and multiple such <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> s could be hidden beneath one <code>useComplexStuff</code> hook call.</p>\n<p>Let's go through the use-cases mentioned above but using functional components now.</p>\n<h4 id=\"user-content-when-a-component-loads-1\"><a href=\"#when-a-component-loads-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>When a component loads</h4>\n<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span><span>MyComponent</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>// unlike class components, each state variable is individually stored</span>\n  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n\n  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>{</span>\n      <span>setData</span><span>(</span>data<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n      <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n\n  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>loading<span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>\"Loading...\"</span><span>;</span>\n\n  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&#x3C;</span><span>User</span></span> <span>data</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>data<span>.</span><span>user</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/></span></span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Please go through it and let me know if you've any questions.

This makes our code less verbose and more declarative. Unlike class example, we're really asking react to get results whenever query updates.</p>\n<p>You might have observed how I've not used <code>async/await</code> syntax within a <code>useEffect</code> yet. It's because the <code>CallbackType</code> isn't an <code>async</code> function and it's expecting a callback in return, not a promise.

Rules that have a hyphen are camel cased. So <code>margin-right</code> becomes <code>marginRight</code>. Also, you can pass numbers wherever applicable, <code>px</code> unit would be taken for those. So <code>marginRight: 10</code> is same as <code>margin-right: 10px;</code></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike CSS you can't define <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes\">pseudo classes</a> like <code>:hover</code> or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements\">pseudo elements</a> like <code>::after</code>. You can achieve that by defining a CSS class outside of React and using it as <code>className</code> or using CSS-in-JS libraries like <a href=\"https://styled-components.com/\">styled-components</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-react-native\"><a href=\"#react-native\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>React Native</h2>\n<p>Now that we've covered most of the basic fundamentals of ReactJS, let's see how <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">React Native</a> is different. In all our above examples, we're actually using ReactJS along with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html\">ReactDOM</a>. It's the driver that knows what to do when we write a heading like follows.</p>\n<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&#x3C;</span>h1</span> <span>style</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> color<span>:</span> <span>\"red\"</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span></span><span>></span></span><span>Hello</span><span><span><span>&#x3C;/</span>h1</span><span>></span></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It converts the <code>h1</code> to respective HTML <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\">DOM</a> element, and applies the styling to it. So we can see that ReactJS (class components, state, lifecycle, props, composability, hooks etc.) is actually host platform agnostic. It can run on any platform as long as you provide a driver for the same. On Native platforms, <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">react-native</a> does that. You can image that we can't use <code>h1</code> and the like on native as they don't understand HTML. Instead, we've things like <code>TextView</code> on Android and <code>UITextView</code> on iOS and so on for all native UI elements. The driver takes care of mapping a <code>&#x3C;View style={{backgroundColor: 'red'}}>&#x3C;/View></code> into a <code>UIView</code> object with background property set as \"red\" for iOS, likewise for Android.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/assets/diagram_ios-android-views.svg\" alt=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/assets/diagram_ios-android-views.svg\"></p>\n<p>So apart from using components like <code>View</code> <code>Text</code> <code>TextInput</code> <code>Image</code> etc in place of <code>div</code> <code>span</code> <code>input</code> <code>img</code> (respectively), the fundamentals remain the same. There's one more difference however, and that is styling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just like native platforms don't understand HTML, they don't understand CSS either. Authors of React Native made <a href=\"https://yogalayout.com/docs\">Yoga</a> a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox\">flexbox</a> implementation along with a CSS rule subset to native styling translation layer for native platforms.</li>\n<li>Another thing is that unlike HTML where you can basically create any sort of hierarchy of elements, even if it doesn't make sense, React Native is more strict. Strings are only accepted by <code>&#x3C;Text/></code> and you can't place strings inside a <code>&#x3C;View /></code>, similarly rules around text (color, fontSize etc) don't have any effect on a <code>&#x3C;View /></code>. You need to assign it to the <code>&#x3C;Text /></code> directly.</li>\n<li>Also the API of <code>style</code> prop is slightly different. We'll cover it next.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-react-native-styling\"><a href=\"#react-native-styling\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span>🔗 </span></a>React Native Styling</h3>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html\">react-dom</a>, <code>style</code> prop is slightly different in the sense that it also accepts an array.

This can be helpful if a key in <code>this.state</code> is an object or function and you can't determine whether a state update is needed whenever you set it. Secondly, it is expecting answer to <code>should component update?</code> and not <code>are props the same?</code>. Other than that it's pretty much the same. You can imagine writing it by hand and having a dozen of checks for a large component can be tedious and error-prone. If only we had a default behaviour of <code>React.memo</code> for classes. Enter <code>React.PureComponent</code></p>\n<p>Just like <code>React.Component</code>, <code>React.PureComponent</code> is another class you can extend from to create your component. It behaves just like a regular component, but has a <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> lifecycle method implemented for you.</p>\n<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyComponent</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span><span>Component</span></span> <span>{</span>\n  state <span>=</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>\n\n  <span>render</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>return</span> <span>(</span>\n      <span><span><span>&#x3C;</span></span><span>></span></span><span></span>\n<span>        </span><span><span><span>&#x3C;</span>button</span>\n          <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span>s <span>=></span> <span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> s<span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span>\n        <span>></span></span><span></span>\n<span>          </span><span>{</span>count<span>}</span><span></span>\n<span>        </span><span><span><span>&#x3C;/</span>button</span><span>></span></span><span></span>\n<span>        </span><span><span><span>&#x3C;</span><span>Library</span></span> <span>version</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>1<span>\"</span></span> <span>/></span></span><span></span>\n<span>      </span><span><span><span>&#x3C;/</span></span><span>></span></span>\n    <span>)</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>}</span>\n<span>}</span>\n\n<span>// ✅ Works as reference of this.props.version doesn't change as it's a string</span>\n<span>class</span> <span>Library</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span><span>PureComponent</span></span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>render</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>const</span> <span>{</span> version <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&#x3C;</span>h1</span><span>></span></span><span>The library version is </span><span>{</span>version<span>}</span><span><span><span>&#x3C;/</span>h1</span><span>></span></span><span>;</span>\n  <span>}</span>\n<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And just like <code>React.memo</code> it would fail if the said prop is an object or function that updates in each render.
