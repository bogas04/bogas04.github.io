This pandemic, me and my partner, like most of us, started focusing on our diets. We tried to optimize the nutrition that we got from our meals by tracking our calories & protein intake. The bookkeeping motivated me to work on a calorie tracking app for ourselves that accounts for Indian ingredients with a simpler UI. More about that in future posts maybe.

## How much protein do we need to eat after all?

In our journey through the jungle of nutrition sciences, we realized that while it's fairly simple to calculate how many calories we should be having each day, it isn't so clear when it comes to protein. Here are some of the claims we encountered:

> - Babies need about 10 grams a day.
> - School-age kids need 19-34 grams a day.
> - Teenage boys need up to 52 grams a day.
> - Teenage girls need 46 grams a day.
> - Adult men need about 56 grams a day.
> - Adult women need about 46 grams a day (71 grams, if [pregnant](https://www.webmd.com/baby/default.htm) or [breastfeeding](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics))

[WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/protein)

> The recommended intake for a healthy adult is 46 grams of protein a day for women and 56 grams for men.

[NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/well/eat/how-much-protein-do-we-need.html)

> The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) is 0.36 grams of protein per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of body weight.

[HealthLine](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day)

> This equates roughly to 15% to 25% of total daily calories, although it could be above or below this range depending on your age, sex, and activity level.

[Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096)

> Current USDA dietary guidelines suggest that adult men and women consume between 10 and 35% of their total calories from protein

As you can see, some account for body weight, some for gender while some for your caloric needs. It's harder to hit a goal when the goal keeps slightly shifting from one source to another. While all are correct under some assumptions, we chased after accuracy to understand the claims better. I hope our findings help you in your health goals as they take a more holistic approach that works for our different genders, BMIs, age and acitvity levels.

## Step 1: Calculate your caloric needs

I think calculating your daily caloric requirements from your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and activity level is pretty much a standard. James Arthur Harris and Francis Gano Benedict published an equation for BMR in 1919, which got revised over the next few decades. This is how the latest formula from 1990 looks like:

| Gender | Formula                                                                  |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Men    | `(10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5`   |
| Women  | `(10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161` |

The BMR you get from this indicates the MINIMUM amount of calories you NEED to consume daily in order to keep your body healthy. If you're planning to lose weight, I would recommend stay at least 200 calories away from this number. I am not sure if enough research is done for non-binaries, but I guess one could estimate by considering the values for both genders.

My BMR comes out to be `1656 kCal`.

Now you can multiply the BMR with your activity level like so.

Activity Level | Ratio
Little to no exercise | 1.2
Light exercise (1-3 days per week) | 1.375
Moderate exercise (3-5 days per week) | 1.55
Heavy exercise (6-7 days per week) | 1.725
Very heavy exercise (twice per day, extra heavy workouts) | 1.9

For a couch potato like me, let's go with little to no exercise to see how it pans out. This means, I need to have `1987 kCal` daily in order to maintain my weight. I can reduce this to, say, `1750 kCal` to **lose weight** quickly, or increase it to, say, `2150 kCal` to **gain weight** drastically. This makes sense so far.

## Step 2: Pick a ratio and calculate macro intake

Now that you know your caloric needs, use any safe macro ratio based on your goal.

> The acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDR) are 45–65% of your daily calories from carbohydrates, 20–35% from fats and 10–35% from protein.
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-macronutrient-ratio](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-macronutrient-ratio)

By safe, I mean that you need to ensure you remain within the limits of each macro. Too little or too much of something would eventually damage your organs.

But how do we know how much calories we're getting from a macro? You might not be aware, but to our body, digesting a gram of fat roughly results in 9 kilo calories, while a gram of carbohydrate or protein results in 4 kilo calories. Let's see how these numbers pan out for my case:

| Macro         |     Minimum calories      |  Minimum grams  |      Maximum calories       |   Maximum grams   |
| :------------ | :-----------------------: | :-------------: | :-------------------------: | :---------------: |
| Carbohydrates | 894.15 kCal (45% of 1987) | 224g (894.15/4) | 1,291.55 kCal (65% of 1987) | 323g (1,291.55/4) |
| Protein       | 198.7 kCal (10% of 1987)  |  50g (198.7/4)  |  695.45 kCal (35% of 1987)  |  174g (695.45/4)  |
| Fat           | 397.4 kCal (20% of 1987)  | 44.2g (397.4/9) |   695.45 kCal (35% 1987)    | 77.3g (695.45/9)  |

This makes most sense to me as it accounts for my age, my gender, my current weight and my activity level.

Now this is obviously a lot of calculation. I would recommend that you use a calculator.
