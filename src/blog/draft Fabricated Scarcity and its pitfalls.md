Yes I'm privileged and sayings like "self-made" makes no sense when I had access to education,
internet and just general freedom to do stuff without worrying about starvation, lynching or death.
There are millions of people like me who earn well enough, yet somehow we're stuffed with
generational scarcity mindset. Maybe your parents didn't earn well enough and had to hustle through their lives.
Maybe you too are hustling to ensure you're able to pay the next bill and not get evicted.
That's fair and godspeed to you. But what about those who earn so much,
yet physically can't allow themselves to spend some time or money on themselves. 

You may be earning in lakhs per annum, or even month, but you're conditioned to reject anything
remotely close to luxury, and are driven primarily by the money that you're not making.
Your mind tries to minmax & you regularly say "kya fayda" (what's the profit in this). 

There's nothing wrong with earning more and more money. In fact I would say always try to negotiate
a better offer coz your employer would never give you anything remotely close to what you deserve
(they're minmaxing too). But it should never come at cost of becoming slave to it.

* Taking a job solely based on salary, keeping good work-life boundary at bottom of your criteria
coz "this is the age to hustle".
* Ignoring your health/sleep/posture coz I gotta FIRE man.
* Not taking time to enjoy the money you make, coz "what about my unborn child's wedding?"
* Not spending time with your child/spouse/friends coz work is everything, why, isn't it
masculine af to grind your ass off for work and never let emotions take up any space in your life.
* Or saying "I'll never become like my father" who can't  retire in peace, but has to work no matter what
or else he'll get depressed (Humanity 0, Capitalism 1). Yet ignoring the signs of how work is creeping
into your life, dreams, jokes, persona, growing like a parasite.

These are some of the examples of how this scarcity mindset is allowing work/money/career eat away
the most precious thing you've in your life, your life!

So hustle & follow your dreams, chase better salaries, at the same time don't let that hustle eat 
away your life. Do ask yourself, whether the scarcity is real or fabricated? Is the purpose of my
life defined by my bank balance? Will more money equate to more real happiness? At what cost? Does 
success mean having more than **others** or having more than **enough** for your needs?
