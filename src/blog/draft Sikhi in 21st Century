Sikhi is one of the most recent religions to have existed with quite universal and progressive foundation. From fighting caste and class heirarchies to abolishing some of the evil practices of the time such as Sati, one can argue it had profound impact on Hindusthani society during the Bhakti Movement. However, it's a new millennium and 21 years into the 21st century, we need to challenge and ponder over how it can remain relevant for the next 500 years.

## Headless Internal Heirarchies 

One of the major accomplishments of 10 Guru Nanaks was to bring together folks from Abrahmic as well as Dharmic religions and unify them ideologically. However, after the 11th and the final Guru, I feel heirarchies and differences started manifesting in the panth.This was already evident with various conflicting sides during the human Nanaks <sri chand, masand, banda singh, naamdhari, akj, radhasoami, nirankari, ...>, but it only got worse once Granth became the Guru. With these sects, we also saw lack of clear leadership from the time of Misls to the current time of Jathas. This only makes room for tensions and confusion while taking the precious time away from actually pressing matters of today and tomorrow. 

## 21st Century Feminism & Sexuality

For a progressive religion, Sikhi does have a lot of denial  and homophobia. It's almost as the Jathas think humans elsewhere can be homosexual but Punjab is somehow 100% hetrosexual. While they're not burnt alive or persecuted, there's lack of acknowledgement and thus lack of laws. Rehat Maryda, a modern document, is completely heteronormative and almost misogynistic. This doesn't really cut for the humans of today, and will probably only become a major mark of primitiveness in coming decades. <soorma singh, ...>.


## Orthodoxy in Secularism

World is more secular than ever, and more atheist than ever. If the religion is to survive, it needs to adapt. Sikhs cry that they have no country of theirs, yet their leaders demonstrate the barbaric "Khalsa Tradition" at every chance. Sikhs have been persecuted since bygones, but their security in faith and indifference to wordly respect is what made them walk the path of Sant Sipahi. Sipahi for the meek, Sant for the egoist. However recent massacres, genocides and acts of mistrust from Government of India have left them very insecure and in a state of terror. Every single attack reminds them of all the wrongs they chant every day in their Ardaas, and frays them from their faith.

What we learn from actions of Terrorized Sikhs is that modern Sikhs, while compassionate enough to serve food and offer housing for poor at every chance possible, lose their cool at every hate-crime and even go as far as executing the perperator. There's bigotry in the notion of compassion here. 

From Sikh history, we do know that such attempts were rather common, and almost every Guru was ridiculed and mocked in one way or another, but violence was always the last resort. Humility and forgiveness were the values that their human leaders chose to demonstrate <guru nanak's bhootna, bhai laina's ignorance of nanak, guru amardas's frail body, guru ramdas's long beard, guru arjun's lahore cleaning, guru har rai's kindness, guru tegh bahadur's matrydom, guru gobind's indifference to loss of family>. Is guru really upset if the Granth is disrespected, or even torn and burnt? Is that what Guru Nanak tried to teach us while keeping his toes towards Ka'ba or disrespecting the aarti of Puri, that 500 years when someone else does this to you, mutilate their body and execute them in "Khalsa Tradition"? Sikhs have probably fallen to the play of "Ego" and it isn't the Guru who gets disrespected but their grandiose purity. Instead, Sikhs should use such acts of hatred aginst them to demonstrate their Haloomi Governance. Making the perpetator serve langar or doing such community service will only convert that hatred into display of love and compassion, something more akin to what Guru's would have liked.
