I'm a vegan for 3 years now and I've been able to have 100g+ protein every day without protein powder (on most days).

## How I do this?

### Be a good SoYBoy

Soya is your friend, not your enemy. If you think you'll get moobs or become a soyboy then you need to learn more. Check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvw7S1gG6aw). The great thing about Soya is that it's a complete protein with entire amino acid profile. Not only that, it's also rich in calcium and iron.

#### But how to have soya?

- Soymilk
  I have about 600ml of sofit soyamilk for coffee/tea etc (2 servings). This alone gives me 19.2g protein.

- Soya Granules/Chunks (AKA TVP)
  I use soya granules or soya chunks in rice/pasta/noodles/sandwiches etc. 30 grams of soya granules will give you 15.6g protein. In case of sandwich I cook them a bit in water + soy sauce/chilly sauce/tobasco or any other flavour of choice and then use the soya granules or chunks as a filling in sandwich.

- Tofu
  I also use tofu in rice/pasta/noodles/sandwiches/scrambles. 50g of Briyas tofu will give you 9.94g protein.

- Soya Flour
  Lastly if your diet primarily involves of Roti and you seldom have stir fries/rice/noodles/pasta/sandwiches then use 30% soya flour in your dough. Assuming 1 roti is 50g wheat, by doing 15g soya flour and 35g wheat you go 5.45 g protein (pure wheat) to 11.61g protein (30% soya flour). It's almost doubled.

So if you have 50g tofu in a sandwich, 2 soya+wheat roties, 600ml soyamilk and 30g soya granules in a pasta, just this much will give you (9.94 + 23.22 + 19.2 + 15.6) 67.96g protein, and we're not even counting the protein you get from rice/bread/pasta/noodle or any other veggie right now.ggg

### Be smart with your ingredients

Even if you don't have this much soya, you can still increase your protein intake by using other ingredients:

- Instead of rice, use quinoa or barley as they're better in nutrition
- nutritional yeast
- seitan
- zuchini
