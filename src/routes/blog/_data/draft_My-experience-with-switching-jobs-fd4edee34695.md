> I recently switched my job and this post is all about it.

A portion of my reader base (0/n% = 0%) might be aware that I recently switched my job. For those who aren’t aware of this change (n/n% = 100%), here’s some background.

I was working as a Software Engineer in Samsung R&D, Bangalore (Jun 2016-Oct 2017), wherein I mostly worked on [Samsung Internet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/samsung-internet/epejdmjgfibjaffbmojllapapjejipkh) PC Extension, which by the way is doing phenomenal since I joined the team, and even better after I left (not sure what it tells about me).

Besides the extension, most of my working hours also contributed to creation and deployment of revamped [Gaana.com’](https://gaana.com/)s web application for [Tizen OS](http://www.tizenstore.com/main/getDetail.as?Id=kNWnnj0vTH) for mobiles. The revamp makes use of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) (it’s savior for a complex state machine a music app is) and [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/). At the time of writing, the application is actually a part of [MyGalaxy](http://www.samsung.com/in/microsite/my-galaxy/) App for Tizen.

Finally, I also got a chance to work with Bixby team to improve accuracy of [Samsung Internet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser&hl=en) for [Bixby English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2IM_wHrSQ8).

All in all, my experience with SRIB was fantastic! The kind of exposure a fresher can get from joining this company is simply amazing. Apart from the daily work, I also got an opportunity to work in the [HQ](https://medium.com/@bogas04/living-in-suwon-korea-1b3afd88a2ab), and even focus on my [health](https://medium.com/@bogas04/how-i-lost-15-kgs-82b2302f205e). Why did I make the switch then, you’d ask?

#### The Change

> “If everything was so amazing, what made you switch jobs ?”. Honestly, I didn’t even plan this. What caused this change of events was an interview call from a startup.

I wasn’t even planning to switch my job, but this call for a startup changed it all. The startup was a a B2B log Management company. This was my first front-end related job interview, and I was as thrilled as I was nervous.

Task for 1st round, implement above mockup in framework of choice, without using libraries/data-list for auto-complete, in 24 hours.

Despite my nervousness, I cleared the rounds well enough to actually land myself with an offer from that company. My posting would’ve been in Noida (closer to my hometown), and the work was all around frontend. You can find the interview questions [here](https://gist.github.com/bogas04/b0d72ec3056422b25eeaa07fe74228b5). I even visited their office and talked to some of the employees working there.

But, something didn’t quite feel right. It wasn’t any particular thing, but something about the job, office, employees & the city was putting me off. In fact the offer and pay was much, much better, but “I” didn’t quite like it from the very first impression.

#### And the another change

Amidst this dilemma, and comforting myself with a dozen of reasons to not worry too much about it, I saw this tweet

And without giving a single thought, I applied for it straightaway. Without thinking that I had already accepted an offer. Without thinking that I was already in notice period. This is probably the most stupid thing that one could do. Not being true to your word is seen as cowardly… Let’s talk about that in a moment.

Speaking of Housing.com, my interview was over within 60 minutes. We talked about my experience, React, PWAs, service workers, all the cool things in the industry. Since they knew that I already got an offer from aforementioned startup, I feel my interview wasn’t as lengthy as it would’ve been otherwise. The company, culture & city was exactly what I hoping to go for if I ever wanted to leave Samsung. Furthermore, the interview made me feel like that this job role was just the thing I was looking for. I was clear in my mind that I _really, really_ want to go for this job.

#### The rejection

Even though my dilemma was sorted out, I was sitting with two offers in hand, one of which was expecting me to join in roughly 2 weeks. A company invests a lot of time and effort to conduct interviews and prepare offer letter. Rejecting AFTER accepting the offer isn’t quite an honorable thing to do. In the defense of candidates, companies do try to persuade you to sign the offer letter as soon as possible, sometimes months before your joining date. Also, there are cases where companies reject or defer the offer after rolling it out, something that isn’t unheard of in the startup space of India. Even then, I feel guilty for making this move, but I had made my mind.

If you’ve been in such a situation before, please let me know what you did and how you felt after that? One thing I would like to say is that you should inform the said company as soon as possible, and refer some candidates to them to make up a bit for the mess your rejection created.

#### Salary negotiation

After finally making up my mind, salary negotiations took place. One thing that I noticed is that tech people don’t really bother with the negotiations, and often accept whatever is offered right away. However, I would like to share some of the tips which I found to be effective in my journey. I contacted several seniors & HRs colleagues and read countless articles to come up with this negotiation strategy.

My suggestion is to first write down your expectations;

- What the company might offer based on your interviews and previous pay?
- What are your expectations? (best case | average case | barely acceptable case).
- How will you justify your expectations?

Let’s take an example to understand this.  
**Note:** the currency and units are fictitious.

I was getting 100 million Zelda rupees from my company. I was expecting a hike of 20% by EoFY.

- I need at least 30%, i.e. extra 10% for the hassle of relocating & adjusting to a new city.
- The cost of living of the new city is going to be 20–30% more.
- I don’t have any major upcoming expenditures, so bonus isn’t of priority as is the pay hike.
- I’ll be open to stock options as the last resort because I don’t know how the company is performing from outside (unless it’s has an IPO).

Based on this, I should at least demand for 40–60% hike.

- If they offer 20% hike, I would tell them that it is under my expectation as I’m anyway going to get 20% hike from my current employer.
- If they offer 30% hike, I would explain that the city I’ve to move to is 20–30% more expensive.
- If they offer 40% hike, I would still ask for more hike, if not that then more joining bonus as it would help with initial costs of flat deposit etc.
- If they offer 50% hike, I would ask for relocation bonuses/reimbursement for travel tickets/accommodation for 1 week or so to help me move easily.
- If they offer 60% hike, I’ll gladly accept and ask for breakdown.

And this is how I was confident and knew what to reply with during the negotiation. It’s very hard to follow the numbers and discussion during the call, doing your homework surely helps a lot. I also converted percentages to figures so that it’s easier to deal with them.

I hope my story helps you in some way or another! It has been 2 months since I joined Housing.com and am really happy with my decision. The office and work are fantastic, I already got to make significant contributions within first few weeks.

Some more **advanced** questions;

- What is `this` in following cases; global namespace, function in global namespace, a method of an object, a class method, arrow function?
- How to update `nth` position of a `string`?
- What is `prototype` and how it’s used for inheritance?
- How to stop hoisting of a `function` ?
