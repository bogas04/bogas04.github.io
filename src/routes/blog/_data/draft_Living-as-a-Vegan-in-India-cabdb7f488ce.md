You might know from my previous post that I underwent a body transformation by losing 20 kilograms over 6 months. I touch about my diet change from vegetarianism to veganism.

Let's talk about that.

### The What

If you havenâ€™t encountered one yet, a vegan is a person who tries best to avoid the conversation but lands in it anyway due to extreme penetration of animal products in modern human lifestyle.

Basically, a vegan doesnâ€™t consume or use products that are a derivate of an animal to the extent that is practical. So no meat, no eggs, no milk, no honey, no leather, no gelatin, no animal tested products.

### The Why

Why not? Itâ€™s

- âœ… Good for health.
- âœ… Good for environment.
- âœ… Good for animals.
- ðŸš« Makes it harder to eat outside or snack on processed foods.
- ðŸš« Might require you to spend some extra time under sun.
- ðŸš« Cheaper since you would be cooking more often than eating outside.
- ðŸš« Social acceptance is pretty bad. People make fun of you or ask about your micro nutrients.

Most of the questions are answered pretty well in this video;

Enough said.

(TODO: Add links for each and every word). Multiple peer reviewed research papers, documentaries, actual case studies, environmental affects and a tonne of other information is already out there. I feel if you are really curious and have a decent internet connection, you can figure out why such a diet exists.

### The How

Even though India is vegetarian friendly, surprisingly itâ€™s quite lactose heavy. Dishes are often cooked with ghee, curd or buttermilk. Almost all the sweets are made using khoya. This can become quite a big problem for a vegan in India. Luckily, some of the cuisines within Indian cuisine family are not only vegan, but also gluten-free!
